# ACS_Hackathon_2020
Final game product is under Game Menu folder.

This was a project for the Australian Computing Society's #FlattenTheCurve Hackathon, which ended up being a finalist entry. This was a hackathon to help come up with solutions to solve some issues that arose due to this pandemic.

The objective was to build a set of games to educate young children on good/safe etiquette and social distancing behaviour during the Coronavirus pandemic.

The games are built using Game Maker Studio 2 IDE, written in GML.
